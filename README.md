# 360 Camera Metadata

## In one sentence

This repository exists to accumulate and understand file formats and metadata standards generated by 360 cameras.

## Why we built this

We build software that processes 360 video and image files. In many cases these files contain telemetry data (e.g are geotagged).

Before processing them, we need to understand the format (or standard) of files each camera produces to process it correctly.

This repository contains our research to aid others building similar tools.

## Help us build better software

Unfortunately we don’t have the budget to buy every single 360 camera to test the photos and videos they produce with our software.

Whilst having standards like EXIF and XMP is very helpful, many manufacturers do things slightly differently (especially given the flexibility of fields in XMP data).

In order to make sure our [free, open-source software works for everyone](https://github.com/trek-view/), we need to test it using 360 image and video files produced by a range of cameras and manufacturers.

And that’s why we need your help.

If you have a 360 camera and want to support our work, [please share more information about your camera with us using this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScgOk1W5jpyrQuDF5FuKqUpKK0EIpSlokckZd3OB-r_ZOjZmQ/viewform). Thank you!
